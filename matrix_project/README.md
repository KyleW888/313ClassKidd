## Purpose of Software 
A simple matrix library implemented in both C++ and C. Program does basic matrix operations such as addition, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication.

## FILES

### C++ Implementation:
- matrix.h: Header file which has the Matrix class declaration.
- matrix.cpp: The implementation of the Matrix class.
- main.cpp: Used to test Matrix functionn/operations.

### C Implementation:
- `matrix_c.h`: Header file for the C version of the matrix library.
- `matrix_c.c`: Implementation of the matrix functions in C.
- `main_c.c`: Test file for the C version.
